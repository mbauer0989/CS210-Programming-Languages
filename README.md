# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was built to display a user menu accepting input for deposits, interest, and amount of years. It then prints a report for the amount of interest accrued for a certain amount of years. 

# What did you do particularly well?
The code looks very clean and makes good use of white space. I also accounted for possible bad input from the user and throwing errors if that happens.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The menu display function is not optimal and could user improvement to make it cleaner. My output is also not formatted perfectly and could use refinement there. I am sure I am missing things as nothing is perfect and can always use improvement.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I would not say anything in this project was overly challenging but the checking for bad input made me have to think of all the possibilities a user could do. One simple thing that caused an issue was not clearing the input, this caused some trouble that I was unaware would happen. I overcame this by continuing to try and make progress little by little. I would not say I am adding anything to my support that was not there but refining how to find specific things using google. I also look back at past programs I have completed to remember how I overcame a problem that may help me with a current problem

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Displaying a user menu and accepting user input while checking that input will be transferable. As well as keeping the input clear to accept more input may be a problem again and now, I know that this can cause an issue. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used comments so that the code is explained for future use. If it needed to be tweaked the comments allows someone to understand how the program runs. I kept it clean and used good style in order to make it readable. I tried to make things in multiple functions that way features could be added without having to go in and change multiple functions completely.
